# OMSCS Lecture Notes

This repository contains lecture notes for the classes I am taking or have taken in OMSCS.

Each set of notes for a particular class will live in a subdirectory of the repository root. In each subdirectory,
the notes are presented in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) format.

### Upcoming Courses

- IIS (Fall 2019)

### Completed Courses

- GIOS
- CN

If you notice any grammatical errors or flagrantly confusing sentences, please open a PR and point them out. I proofread my notes after taking them, but mistakes do slip through.

#### Thank you and happy studying!
