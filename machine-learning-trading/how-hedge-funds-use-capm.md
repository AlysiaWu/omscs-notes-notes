# How Hedge Funds Use the CAPM

## Risks for Hedge Funds

A typical hedge fund develops methods to find performant stocks. The informational edge they are seeking is usually market-relative, meaning that they are looking for stocks that rise more than the market when the market goes up or stocks that fall less than the market when the market goes down. If the information they have is reliable, they can take advantage of the CAPM to virtually guarantee a positive return.
